# The Sun

- Radius: $6.9 x 10^8 m$ ≈ 110 $R_{Earth}$
- Mass: $2 x 10^{30}kg$ ≈ 300,000 Earths
- Density of core ≈ $150 \frac{g}{cm^3}$
- Mostly Helium and Hydrogen
- Core ≈ 50,000,000ºK
- Sun is powered by nuclear energy - Fusion
	- $\frac{Nuclear \ Fusion}{Luminosity} $~$\ 4.6 \ Billion \ Years$
- Nuclear processes
	- **Fission** - Big nucleus splits into smaller pieces and releases energy
	- **Fusion** - Two nuclei combine to make a bigger one and release energy
		- Two nuclei can combine up to Iron (most stable element)
- Proton-proton chain - how hydrogen fuses into helium in the Sun
	- Start with 4 protons, two smash together, one becomes neutron, one stays proton
	- Give off 1 neutrino and 1 positron for each
	- Another proton smashes into the original hydrogen fuse - releases gamma ray
	- Outcome - 1$^4HE$ - 0.7% less mass than when it started
- Radiation zone
	- Energy transported upward by photons
	- 32% of volume and 48% of mass
- Convection zone
	- 66% of volume and 2% of mass
	- $0.0000002\frac{g}{cm^3}$
- Solar rotation
	- Tachocline - Rotation period / fraction of sun's radius
- Neutrino
	- Not obstructed in space
	- Arrive at Earth 8.5 minutes after they're emitted
	- 1,500,000 times smaller than electron's mass
	- Neutrinos are barely affected by anything in the universe
	- Super-Kamiokande neutrino detector
- Chromosphere (mid-layer of atmosphere)
	- Middle layer of solar atmosphere
	- 2000km deep (rather thin)
	- Hotter than the photosphere
	- Gas shooting out of spicules at 50,000kph
- Corona (upper layer of atmosphere)
	- rises in millions of kelvin
	- Average 1MºK - 3MºK
- Magnetic field
	- Flips ever 12 years
	- Sun has many poles during a filp - chaotic magnetic action
	- Prominences are anchored to the Sun's surface in the photosphere and extend outwards into the corona
	- Extend millions of kilometers
- Prominences - Created when N and S magnetic arcs touch at the 'x-point'
- Flares - Flash of light during reconnection
- Coronal mass ejection
	- "X-Class flares" - rare
	- Takes 1-3 days to reach earth
		- Shut down transformers and satellites to save them from solar damage

Exoplanets
- Planet Detection
	- **Direct**: pictures or spectra of the planets themselves
	- **Indirect**: measure surrounding area and star to determine location
	- Methods
		- Astrometry, Radial velocity, **Transits**, Direct imaging
- Doppler Effect
	- $f$ (pitch)
	- *Apparent change in frequency* as an object moves past a stationary object
	- If object is moving towards us, the emission-line spectrum will be blue shifted
	- If object is moving away from us, the emission-line spectrum will be red shited
	- Highly eccentric orbits look like ocean waves on doppler shift data
	- Lower eccentric orbits look like a sine wave
