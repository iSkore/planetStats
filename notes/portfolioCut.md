### Science *Defined*
- ### Scientific method (inductive)
	- No authority other than observation
	- Facts are true to the best of our current ability to tell
	- Collect data based on observations and draw conclusion

- ### Scientific Law
	- Describes *how* nature behaves *without explaining why* nature behaves that way
	- Every law of nature is subject to change based on observations

- ### Scientific Theory
	- A theory is a synthesis of large body of information that encompasses well tested laws and hypothesis

- ### Hypothesis?
	- A *hypothesis* is an *educated guess* about why something happens
	- Must be *testable* and *falsifiable*
	- Scientific hypothesis must generate predictions (predict outcome of observations/experiments)
	- Choose the simplest one with least varying outcomes (Occam's Razor)

- ### Interesting
	- 30% - 50% of all scientific discoveries are accidental
	- Louis Pasteur created penicillin on accident by leaving a petri dish out - mold grew and killed the bacteria
	- Astronomy - Study of space and physical evidence
	- Astrology - Study of zodiacs and astrological influences
	- Why is Galileo referred to as "Galileo"? Newton isn't referred to as "Isaac," "Kepler," etc.

# Laws and Basics

- ### Mass
	- The *amount* of matter in an object
- ### Weight
	- The *force* that acts upon an object

- ### Distance
	- Distance is proportional to the square of the time
		- $d $~$ t^2$

- ### Motion
	- **Speed**: rate at which object covers distance
		- $\ speed = \frac{distance\ traveled}{elapsed\ time} $
	- **Velocity**: speed and direction
		- $\ 10 \frac{m}{s} $
	- **Acceleration**: any change in velocity (speed *or* direction)
		- $\frac{m}{s^2} $

- ### Newton's Laws
	- **$1^{st}$ Law**
		- An object moves at constant velocity unless a force acts on it
	- **$2^{nd}$ Law**
		- Force = mass x acceleration
		- $ F_{net} = ma $
	- **$3^{rd}$ Law**
		- For every force, there is always an equal and opposite reaction force.

- ### Force (Newtons)
	- $ 1 N = 1_{kg} • 1 \frac{m}{s^2} $

- ### Kepler's Laws
	- **$1^{st}$ Law**
		- Orbital Ellipse is *not* a circle
	- **$2^{nd}$ Law**
		- Orbit sweeps same area in equal time
	- **$3^{rd}$ Law**
		- $\ p^2 = a^3 $
		- The orbital period (in years) squared is proportionate (~) to the distance in AU's cubed

- ### Acceleration of Gravity
	- All falling objects accelerate at the same rate (not counting friction of air resistance
	- On Earth: $ g ≈ 9.8 \frac{\frac{m}{s}}{s} ( or \frac{m}{s^2}) $

- ### Momentum and Force
	- **Momentum** = mass x velocity
		- $P = mv$
	- **Net Force** changes momentum, which means there is an acceleration
		- Total of all forces - accounts for the direction
		- Net force results in acceleration
	- **Angular momentum**
		- angular momentum = mass x velocity x distance
			- $ P_a = mvd $

- ### Energy
	- **Kinetic (motion)**
	- **Radiative (light)**
	- **Potential (stored)**
	- Energy is measure in **Joules**
		- $ 1_{Joule} = 1_{kg} • \frac{m}{s}^2 $

- ### Conservation Laws
	- Conservation of energy (time)
	- Conservation of momentum (position)
	- Conservation of angular momentum (direction)

- ### Thermal Energy
	- Lower temperature: slower moving particles
	- Higher temperature: faster moving particles

- ### Gravitational Potential Energy
	- Mass, gravity, height
		- $m•g•h$

- ### Dark Energy
	- `68.3%` dark energy - `26.8%` dark matter - `4.9%` matter
	- *Biggest mystery in all of physics*

- ### Angular momentum
	- An object's angular momentum cannot change unless an external twisting force (torque) is exerted

- ### Kepler - $2^{nd} $ Law
	- $ F\ $~$\ m_1m_2 $
	- $ F = m • g $

	- $ a = g = \frac{g}{1^2} $

	- $F_G = \frac{G • M_1 • M_2}{d^2} $
	- $ G = 6.67 • 10^{-11} N \frac{m^2}{kg^2} $
	- Every object in the universe attracts every other particle in the universe

- ### Kepler - $3^{rd} $ Law
	- $ p^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{G(m_1 + m_2)}•a^3 $ *or* $ M_1 + M_2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{G}\frac{a^3}{p^2} $
	- How to find the mass of a planet

- ### Tangential speed
	- If object is shot at 8 km/s - it will become a satellite
	- Earth escape velocity: $ v_{escape} = 11.2 \frac{km}{s} $
	- Changing an orbit
		- friction or atmospheric drag
		- gravitational encounter

- ### Light and Matter
	- 4 forces of nature
		- Gravity (infinitely extends throughout universe)
		- Electromagnetism (infinitely extends throughout universe)
		- Strong nuclear force (extends about 15 m maximum)

- Planetary temperatures
    - Planet's surface temperature varies based on speed of rotation and distance to the sun
    - Planet's reflectivity (albedo) - the amount of absorbed/reflected light
    - Planets with low albedo absorb more sunlight, leading to hotter temperatures

- Medium-sized moons (300-1500 km)
    - Past (some ongoing) geological activity
    - Enough self-gravity to be spherical - Lots of ice
    - Jupiter: Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto
    - Saturn: Titan, Lapetus, Rhea, Dione, Tethys, Enceladus, Mimas
    - Uranus: Oberon, Titania, Umbriel, Ariel, Miranda

### Jupiter's moons
- **Io**

    - Outgassing plumes shoots material 330 km above surface
    - Material creates Io torus
    - Inner iron or iron sulfide core (20% of mass)
    - 12-40km thick lithosphere
    - How does Io get heated by Jupiter? *Tidal Resonance*
    - Tidal Resonance creates heat by squishing and streching the planet as it orbits
    - Io gets 200 times more heat from tidal forces than Earth gets from radioactivity
    - Elliptical orbit flexs Io's shape
    - 4 Io orbits = 2 Europa orbits = 1 Ganymede orbits
    - This keeps orbit of Io elliptical
    - Orbital Resonance
- **Europa**
    - Smoothest body in the solar system
    - No verticle features (mountains, creators, trenches, etc.)
    - Covered in water ice
    - Massive water ocean under ice crust - believe this because all ice cracks are filled in quickly
    - Lineae are the dominant surface feature - cracks in the ice
    - Tital flexing keeps subsurface ocean liquid (not ice)
    - Surface about 50ºK - 110ºK
    - Ice *might* be 200m - 10km thick (unknown)
    - Metallic core

    - Likely caught from the Oort cloud
    - Frozen ice, rock metal, hydrogen
    - Could have life in internal ocean deep under crust
- **Nereid**
    - Ice ball (little known)
    - Irregular shape

### Saturn's rings
- Ring's objects orbit around Saturn's equator
- Extend from 270,000 km in diameter
- 99.9% pure water ice, 0.1% tholins or silicates
- Main rings are primarily composed of particles ranging from 1cm to 10m
- Dark gaps appear where there are relatively few particles
- Particles frequently collide but move at same velocities - collision is very gentle
- "Shepard moons" that live within the rings
- Rings form when Moons are broken apart at the roche limit

### Asteroids
- Chariklo is surrounded by two dense and narrow rings
- Ceres ~ 950km - 32% the mass of moon

# Portfolio

# Missions to other worlds
- Cassini
    - Exploring Saturn since 2004
    - Enceladus
        - "Found clear evidence of present-day hydrothermal activity on Enceladus" ([NASA | Cassini Mission][0])
        - Hot water temperatures underneath ice shell
    - Titan
        - With mountains, rivers, oceans, etc. - suggests high geological activity
        - First touch down on Titan in 2005
        - Huygens probe is the first human craft to touch down in the outer solar system
        - Could contain habitable environments but the water/ammonia ocean is 35 - 50 miles below the moons surface
    - Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE)
        - Acts as a "weather station" for solar and space activity
        - Measures solar-wind ions, cosmic rays, space wind, etc.
        - Operating since 1997
    - Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
        - Discovered 3000 comets that disintegrate near the sun
        - Pulled in my gravity and destroyed
        - 95% of the discovered comets were by "citizen astronomers" - Enthusiast website watchers that report their findings
    - Voyager 2
        - First man made craft to ever flyby Neptune
        - Triton "was found to be the coldest known planetary body in the solar system" ([NASA | Voyager 2 Mission - Neptune Accomplishments][1])
        - Another moon with ice "volcano" or "cryovolcanism"



# Portfolio questions
- Why does mars have massive lithosphere?
	- And no volcanic activity
	- And *no* earthquakes?
- Is the astroid field to the sun as the saturn rings are to saturn?
- No plate tectonics on Venus
- If ice can squish and stretch more than rock with less force - do we have tectonics because the mass of the moon, and the distance of the sun, were just enough to break the crust up? Seen with Enceladus, the ice crust gets fractured and split.

# Include pictures of milky way taken in Aussie
