# Laws and Basics

- ### Mass
	- The *amount* of matter in an object
- ### Weight
	- The *force* that acts upon an object

- ### Distance
	- Distance is proportional to the square of the time
		- $d $~$ t^2$

- ### Motion
	- **Speed**: rate at which object covers distance
		- $\ speed = \frac{distance\ traveled}{elapsed\ time} $
	- **Velocity**: speed and direction
		- $\ 10 \frac{m}{s} $
	- **Acceleration**: any change in velocity (speed *or* direction)
		- $\frac{m}{s^2} $

- ### Newton's Laws
	- **$1^{st}$ Law**
		- An object moves at constant velocity unless a force acts on it
	- **$2^{nd}$ Law**
		- Force = mass x acceleration
		- $ F_{net} = ma $
	- **$3^{rd}$ Law**
		- For every force, there is always an equal and opposite reaction force.

- ### Force (Newtons)
	- $ 1 N = 1_{kg} • 1 \frac{m}{s^2} $

- ### Kepler's Laws
	- **$1^{st}$ Law**
		- Orbital Ellipse is *not* a circle
	- **$2^{nd}$ Law**
		- Orbit sweeps same area in equal time
	- **$3^{rd}$ Law**
		- $\ p^2 = a^3 $
		- The orbital period (in years) squared is proportionate (~) to the distance in AU's cubed

- ### Acceleration of Gravity
	- All falling objects accelerate at the same rate (not counting friction of air resistance
	- On Earth: $ g ≈ 9.8 \frac{\frac{m}{s}}{s} ( or \frac{m}{s^2}) $

- ### Momentum and Force
	- **Momentum** = mass x velocity
		- $P = mv$
	- **Net Force** changes momentum, which means there is an acceleration
		- Total of all forces - accounts for the direction
		- Net force results in acceleration
	- **Angular momentum**
		- angular momentum = mass x velocity x distance
			- $ P_a = mvd $

- ### Energy
	- **Kinetic (motion)**
	- **Radiative (light)**
	- **Potential (stored)**
	- The combination of energy and matter makes up all of the universe
	- Energy can be transferred from one object to another *or* from one form to another
	- Mass is a form of potential energy
	- $ E = mc^2 $ (*very* little energy is needed to make a lot of energy)
	- A small amount of mass can release a great deal of energy
	- Energy is measure in **Joules**
		- $ 1_{Joule} = 1_{kg} • \frac{m}{s}^2 $

- ### Conservation Laws
	- The amount of energy in a system doesn't change
	- Total energy is always conserved
	- Laws of physics are unchanging in time
	- Conservation of energy (time)
	- Conservation of momentum (position)
	- Conservation of angular momentum (direction)

- ### Thermal Energy
	- Lower temperature: slower moving particles
	- Higher temperature: faster moving particles
	- Temperature is the *average* kinetic energy
	- Thermal energy is the *total* kinetic energy of all the particles

- ### Gravitational Potential Energy
	- Mass, gravity, height
		- $m•g•h$

- ### Dark Energy
	- `68.3%` dark energy - `26.8%` dark matter - `4.9%` matter
	- Biggest mystery in all of physics

- ### Angular momentum
	- An object's angular momentum cannot change unless an external twisting force (torque) is exerted
	- Kepler's $2^{nd}$ law revisited
		- Sweeps out equal areas in equal times
		- $ m • v_{small} • a_{large} = m • v_{large} • a_{small} $

- ### Kepler - $2^{nd} $ Law
	- $ F\ $~$\ m_1m_2 $
	- Force between two massive objects decreases with distance (to center)
	- $ F = m • g $

	- $ a = g = \frac{g}{1^2} $

	- $F_G = \frac{G • M_1 • M_2}{d^2} $
	- $ G = 6.67 • 10^{-11} N \frac{m^2}{kg^2} $
	- Every object in the universe attracts every other particle in the universe
	- Example:
		- $ a_{rock} = \frac{F_G}{M_{rock}} $

		- $ a_{rock} = \frac{ G • \frac{ M_{earth} • M_{rock} }{( R_{earth} )^2}}{M_{rock}} $

- ### Kepler - $3^{rd} $ Law
	- $ p^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{G(m_1 + m_2)}•a^3 $ *or* $ M_1 + M_2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{G}\frac{a^3}{p^2} $
	- How to find the mass of a planet

- ### Tangential speed
	- If object is shot at 8 km/s - it will become a satellite
	- Earth escape velocity: $ v_{escape} = 11.2 \frac{km}{s} $
	- Changing an orbit
		- friction or atmospheric drag
		- gravitational encounter

- ### Tides
	- Rise and fall of sea levels caused by the gravitational forces
	- How does gravity cause tides?
		- Tides are caused by gravity pulling on the bodies of water on the Earth and upon the earth itself
		- The difference in moons gravitational pull stretches the earth
	- Side of the tides depends on the phase of the moon
		- The sun is a factor as well
		- During a new moon, the tides are larger because moon and sun pulls
		- During a full moon, the tides are just as large because the moon and sun pull in both directions (takes away from middle)
		- **neap** - when the moon and sun are not aligned to create large tides
	- Synchronous rotation - the moon and the sun rotate at the same amount
	- **Tidal heating** - Tidal forces are important source of heat on many moons
	- **Roche limit** - this occurs when the tidal forces exceed the internal gravity of an object
		- Created the Saturn ring
	- **Cryovolcanism* - Water shoots out from the crust due to gravity orbit

# Light and Waves

- ### Light
	- Radiative energy
	- Measured in `Watts` - $\frac{1 J}{s}$
	- Emission
	- Absorption
	- Transmission
		- Transparent objects transmit light
		- Opaque objects absorb light
	- Reflect/Scatter light
		- Mirror (smooth surface) - reflects back at equal angle
		- Water (rough surface) - reflects back at different angles when choppy
	- Blue jeans reflect blue light and absorbs the other colors
	- Light can act either like a wave or like a particle
	- Light wave is a vibration of electric and magnetic fields
	- #### Particles of Light
		- Each photon has a wavelength and frequency
		- The energy of a photon depends on its frequency:
		- $E = h • f$
		- $h = 6.626 • 10^{-34} Joule•s$ is the Planck constant

- ### Waves
	- Wavelength - measurement from crest to crest
	- Frequency - number of crest that pass through per second
	- Light - $c$
	- $c ≈ 3 • 10^8 \frac{m}{s}$
	- #### Frequency
		- Measured in hertz
		- $\lambda • f = c$
	- **Order**
		- Gamma rays - x-rays - ultraviolet - visible - infrared - radio
	- We only see a tiny sliver of the electromagnetic spectrum: about $400\ nm$ to $750\ nm$
	- The basics of spectrum be broken into three types: emission line spectrum, continuous spectrum, absorption spectrum
	- An object's thermal radiation spectrum depends only on temperature

- ### Termal Radiation
	- Stephan-Boltzmann Law
		- Hotter objects emit more light per unit area at all energies
		- Emitted power ~ $T^4$
	- Wien's Law
		- $\lambda_{max} $~$ \frac{1}{T}$

- ### Continuous Spectrum
	- Comes from hot substance (light bulb) - white light
	- Reflected white light that isn't absorbed or emitted

- ### Emission Line Spectrum
	- Hydrogen spectrum
		- Emits $410.1 nm,\ 434.0 nm,\ 486.1 nm,\ 656.3 nm$
		- As seen through the prism glasses - Hydrogen emits a unique bar code that can be seen
	- Chemical bar code is seen when substance is heated

- ### Absorption Line Spectrum
	- Cloud absorbs certain wavelengths at the exact same length as they emit when heated
	- Example: Hydrogen emits $410.1 nm,\ 434.0 nm,\ 486.1 nm,\ 656.3 nm\ $ when heated and **absorbs** the same frequencies when light passes through

- ### Telescopes
	- Refraction
		- Refraction is the bending of light when it passes from one substance into another
	- Light-collecting area
		- Circular area
			- $Area = \pi(\frac{diameter}{2})^2$
		- KECK - 10 m diameter (Hawaii Telescope)
	- Angular resolution
		- Human eye = 1 arc minute
		- If two sources of light are more than one arc-minute away they appear to be one source of light (like a car)
		- Limit on Angular resolution is called *defraction limit*
	- Refracting Telescope
		- First made by Galileo
		- Use lenses to focus light
	- Reflecting Telescope
		- First made by Newton
		- Curved mirror will reflect light to one focal point
	- Three uses of telescopes

- Planetary temperatures
    - Planet's surface temperature varies based on speed of rotation and distance to the sun
    - Planet's reflectivity (albedo) - the amount of absorbed/reflected light
    - Planets with low albedo absorb more sunlight, leading to hotter temperatures

>Albedo

- Why does Earth's climate stay stable?
    - $CO_2$ Cycle
