### Science *Defined*
- ### Scientific method (inductive)
	- No authority other than observation
	- Facts are true to the best of our current ability to tell
	- Collect data based on observations and draw conclusion

- ### Scientific Law
	- Describes *how* nature behaves *without explaining why* nature behaves that way
	- Every law of nature is subject to change based on observations

- ### Scientific Theory
	- A theory is a synthesis of large body of information that encompasses well tested laws and hypothesis

- ### Hypothesis?
	- A *hypothesis* is an *educated guess* about why something happens
	- Must be *testable* and *falsifiable*
	- Scientific hypothesis must generate predictions (predict outcome of observations/experiments)
	- Choose the simplest one with least varying outcomes (Occam's Razor)

- ### Interesting
	- 30% - 50% of all scientific discoveries are accidental
	- Louis Pasteur created penicillin on accident by leaving a petri dish out - mold grew and killed the bacteria
	- Astronomy - Study of space and physical evidence
	- Astrology - Study of zodiacs and astrological influences
	- Why is Galileo referred to as "Galileo"? Newton isn't referred to as "Isaac," "Kepler," etc.

# Laws and Basics

- ### Mass
	- The *amount* of matter in an object
- ### Weight
	- The *force* that acts upon an object

- ### Distance
	- Distance is proportional to the square of the time
		- $d $~$ t^2$

- ### Motion
	- **Speed**: rate at which object covers distance
		- $\ speed = \frac{distance\ traveled}{elapsed\ time} $
	- **Velocity**: speed and direction
		- $\ 10 \frac{m}{s} $
	- **Acceleration**: any change in velocity (speed *or* direction)
		- $\frac{m}{s^2} $

- ### Newton's Laws
	- **$1^{st}$ Law**
		- An object moves at constant velocity unless a force acts on it
	- **$2^{nd}$ Law**
		- Force = mass x acceleration
		- $ F_{net} = ma $
	- **$3^{rd}$ Law**
		- For every force, there is always an equal and opposite reaction force.

- ### Force (Newtons)
	- $ 1 N = 1_{kg} • 1 \frac{m}{s^2} $

- ### Kepler's Laws
	- **$1^{st}$ Law**
		- Orbital Ellipse is *not* a circle
	- **$2^{nd}$ Law**
		- Orbit sweeps same area in equal time
	- **$3^{rd}$ Law**
		- $\ p^2 = a^3 $
		- The orbital period (in years) squared is proportionate (~) to the distance in AU's cubed

- ### Acceleration of Gravity
	- All falling objects accelerate at the same rate (not counting friction of air resistance
	- On Earth: $ g ≈ 9.8 \frac{\frac{m}{s}}{s} ( or \frac{m}{s^2}) $

- ### Momentum and Force
	- **Momentum** = mass x velocity
		- $P = mv$
	- **Net Force** changes momentum, which means there is an acceleration
		- Total of all forces - accounts for the direction
		- Net force results in acceleration
	- **Angular momentum**
		- angular momentum = mass x velocity x distance
			- $ P_a = mvd $

- ### Energy
	- **Kinetic (motion)**
	- **Radiative (light)**
	- **Potential (stored)**
	- The combination of energy and matter makes up all of the universe
	- Energy can be transferred from one object to another *or* from one form to another
	- Mass is a form of potential energy
	- $ E = mc^2 $ (*very* little energy is needed to make a lot of energy)
	- A small amount of mass can release a great deal of energy
	- Energy is measure in **Joules**
		- $ 1_{Joule} = 1_{kg} • \frac{m}{s}^2 $

- ### Conservation Laws
	- The amount of energy in a system doesn't change
	- Total energy is always conserved
	- Laws of physics are unchanging in time
	- Conservation of energy (time)
	- Conservation of momentum (position)
	- Conservation of angular momentum (direction)

- ### Thermal Energy
	- Lower temperature: slower moving particles
	- Higher temperature: faster moving particles
	- Temperature is the *average* kinetic energy
	- Thermal energy is the *total* kinetic energy of all the particles

- ### Gravitational Potential Energy
	- Mass, gravity, height
		- $m•g•h$

- ### Dark Energy
	- `68.3%` dark energy - `26.8%` dark matter - `4.9%` matter
	- Biggest mystery in all of physics

- ### Angular momentum
	- An object's angular momentum cannot change unless an external twisting force (torque) is exerted
	- Kepler's $2^{nd}$ law revisited
		- Sweeps out equal areas in equal times
		- $ m • v_{small} • a_{large} = m • v_{large} • a_{small} $

- ### Kepler - $2^{nd} $ Law
	- $ F\ $~$\ m_1m_2 $
	- Force between two massive objects decreases with distance (to center)
	- $ F = m • g $

	- $ a = g = \frac{g}{1^2} $

	- $F_G = \frac{G • M_1 • M_2}{d^2} $
	- $ G = 6.67 • 10^{-11} N \frac{m^2}{kg^2} $
	- Every object in the universe attracts every other particle in the universe
	- Example:
		- $ a_{rock} = \frac{F_G}{M_{rock}} $

		- $ a_{rock} = \frac{ G • \frac{ M_{earth} • M_{rock} }{( R_{earth} )^2}}{M_{rock}} $

- ### Kepler - $3^{rd} $ Law
	- $ p^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{G(m_1 + m_2)}•a^3 $ *or* $ M_1 + M_2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{G}\frac{a^3}{p^2} $
	- How to find the mass of a planet

- ### Tangential speed
	- If object is shot at 8 km/s - it will become a satellite
	- Earth escape velocity: $ v_{escape} = 11.2 \frac{km}{s} $
	- Changing an orbit
		- friction or atmospheric drag
		- gravitational encounter

- ### Tides
	- Rise and fall of sea levels caused by the gravitational forces
	- How does gravity cause tides?
		- Tides are caused by gravity pulling on the bodies of water on the Earth and upon the earth itself
		- The difference in moons gravitational pull stretches the earth
	- Side of the tides depends on the phase of the moon
		- The sun is a factor as well
		- During a new moon, the tides are larger because moon and sun pulls
		- During a full moon, the tides are just as large because the moon and sun pull in both directions (takes away from middle)
		- **neap** - when the moon and sun are not aligned to create large tides
	- Synchronous rotation - the moon and the sun rotate at the same amount
	- **Tidal heating** - Tidal forces are important source of heat on many moons
	- **Roche limit** - this occurs when the tidal forces exceed the internal gravity of an object
		- Created the Saturn ring
	- **Cryovolcanism** - Water shoots out from the crust due to gravity orbit

# Light and Waves

- ### Light
	- Radiative energy
	- Measured in `Watts` - $\frac{1 J}{s}$
	- Emission
	- Absorption
	- Transmission
		- Transparent objects transmit light
		- Opaque objects absorb light
	- Reflect/Scatter light
		- Mirror (smooth surface) - reflects back at equal angle
		- Water (rough surface) - reflects back at different angles when choppy
	- Blue jeans reflect blue light and absorbs the other colors
	- Light can act either like a wave or like a particle
	- Light wave is a vibration of electric and magnetic fields
	- #### Particles of Light
		- Each photon has a wavelength and frequency
		- The energy of a photon depends on its frequency:
		- $E = h • f$
		- $h = 6.626 • 10^{-34} Joule•s$ is the Planck constant

- ### Waves
	- Wavelength - measurement from crest to crest
	- Frequency - number of crest that pass through per second
	- Light - $c$
	- $c ≈ 3 • 10^8 \frac{m}{s}$
	- #### Frequency
		- Measured in hertz
		- $\lambda • f = c$
	- **Order**
		- Gamma rays - x-rays - ultraviolet - visible - infrared - radio
	- We only see a tiny sliver of the electromagnetic spectrum: about $400\ nm$ to $750\ nm$
	- The basics of spectrum be broken into three types: emission line spectrum, continuous spectrum, absorption spectrum
	- An object's thermal radiation spectrum depends only on temperature

- ### Termal Radiation
	- Stephan-Boltzmann Law
		- Hotter objects emit more light per unit area at all energies
		- Emitted power ~ $T^4$
	- Wien's Law
		- $\lambda_{max} $~$ \frac{1}{T}$

- ### Continuous Spectrum
	- Comes from hot substance (light bulb) - white light
	- Reflected white light that isn't absorbed or emitted

- ### Emission Line Spectrum
	- Hydrogen spectrum
		- Emits $410.1 nm,\ 434.0 nm,\ 486.1 nm,\ 656.3 nm$
		- As seen through the prism glasses - Hydrogen emits a unique bar code that can be seen
	- Chemical bar code is seen when substance is heated

- ### Absorption Line Spectrum
	- Cloud absorbs certain wavelengths at the exact same length as they emit when heated
	- Example: Hydrogen emits $410.1 nm,\ 434.0 nm,\ 486.1 nm,\ 656.3 nm\ $ when heated and **absorbs** the same frequencies when light passes through

- ### Telescopes
	- Refraction
		- Refraction is the bending of light when it passes from one substance into another
	- Light-collecting area
		- Circular area
			- $Area = \pi(\frac{diameter}{2})^2$
		- KECK - 10 m diameter (Hawaii Telescope)
	- Angular resolution
		- Human eye = 1 arc minute
		- If two sources of light are more than one arc-minute away they appear to be one source of light (like a car)
		- Limit on Angular resolution is called *defraction limit*
	- Refracting Telescope
		- First made by Galileo
		- Use lenses to focus light
	- Reflecting Telescope
		- First made by Newton
		- Curved mirror will reflect light to one focal point

- Planetary temperatures
    - Planet's surface temperature varies based on speed of rotation and distance to the sun
    - Planet's reflectivity (albedo) - the amount of absorbed/reflected light
    - Planets with low albedo absorb more sunlight, leading to hotter temperatures

    - This keeps orbit of Io elliptical
    - Orbital Resonance
- **Europa**
    - Smoothest body in the solar system
    - No verticle features (mountains, creators, trenches, etc.)
    - Covered in water ice
    - Massive water ocean under ice crust - believe this because all ice cracks are filled in quickly
    - Lineae are the dominant surface feature - cracks in the ice
    - Tital flexing keeps subsurface ocean liquid (not ice)
    - Surface about 50ºK - 110ºK
    - Ice *might* be 200m - 10km thick (unknown)
    - Metallic core
    - Rocky mantle
    - Believe ocean of water is 100km deep
- **Ganymede**
    - Largest moon in the solar system
    - Dark regions: very old, highly cratered, $\frac{1}{3}$ the surface
    - Light regions: younger (but still ancient). Indications of water or ice
    - Least effected by orbital resonance
    - Confirmed interior ocean
    - Might have asyncronous orbital rotation inside
- **Callisto**
    - Heavily cratered indicating an old surface that might hide a deeply buried ocean
    - Interior is mostly mixed up of metal and rock
    - If there was an ocean it would be very salty, 50-200km deep, and may be highly conductive fluid
    - Indications of global magnetic field
- **Other Jupiter moons**
    - Small inner moons - at least 4 small within Jupiter's rings
    - Irregular group 1: 7 probable captures in inclined orbits
    - Irregular group 2: 48 probable captures

    - orbits backwards
    - Coldest world in the solar system (38ºK)
    - Reflects more light than pluto
    - High inclination
    - Likely caught from the Oort cloud
    - Frozen ice, rock metal, hydrogen
    - Could have life in internal ocean deep under crust
- **Nereid**
    - Ice ball (little known)
    - Irregular shape

### Saturn's rings
- Ring's objects orbit around Saturn's equator
- Extend from 270,000 km in diameter
- 99.9% pure water ice, 0.1% tholins or silicates
- Main rings are primarily composed of particles ranging from 1cm to 10m
- Dark gaps appear where there are relatively few particles
- Particles frequently collide but move at same velocities - collision is very gentle
- "Shepard moons" that live within the rings
- Rings form when Moons are broken apart at the roche limit

### Asteroids
- Chariklo is surrounded by two dense and narrow rings
- Ceres ~ 950km - 32% the mass of moon
- Pallas ~ 544km
- Vesta ~ 525km
- Some astroids have their own moons (Ida)

# Auxiliary Information
- Ceres made "Planet"
    - 3.6 times more massive than Vesta
    - Density: $2.08\frac{g}{cm^3}$
    - Icy core
- Meteorite Types
    - **Primitive**: unchanged in composition since they first formed 4.6 B years ago
    - **Processed**: younger - have experienced processes like volcanism or differentiation
- Sources of meteorites
    - 5% - 6% of all meteorites found on Earth originate from Vesta
    - 99.8% come from asteroid belt
- Anatomy of a Comet
    - A *coma* is the atmosphere that comes from a comet's heated nucleus
    - Dust tail
    - Plasma tail
- Oort cloud
    - Outer most layer of our solar system
- Any object that orbits the sun is called "Trans-Neptunian Objects"
    - Pluto, Eris, Makemake, Haumea, Kuiper Belt
    - Charon has radius two times larger than pluto
- Pluto
    - Pluto has experienced rapid climate changes
    - Charon is half the size of Pluto but much more active


### Five Major extinction events
| Cretaceous-Paleogene | Triassic-Jurassic | Permian-Triassic | Late Devonian | Ordovician-Silurian |
|----------------------|-------------------|------------------|---------------|---------------------|
|      65.5 MYA        |     205 MYA       |     251 MYA      |     375 MYA   |       450 MYA       |

# Missions to other worlds
- Cassini
    - Exploring Saturn since 2004
    - Enceladus
        - "Found clear evidence of present-day hydrothermal activity on Enceladus" ([NASA | Cassini Mission][0])
        - Hot water temperatures underneath ice shell
    - Titan
        - With mountains, rivers, oceans, etc. - suggests high geological activity
        - First touch down on Titan in 2005
        - Huygens probe is the first human craft to touch down in the outer solar system
        - Could contain habitable environments but the water/ammonia ocean is 35 - 50 miles below the moons surface
    - Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE)
        - Acts as a "weather station" for solar and space activity
        - Measures solar-wind ions, cosmic rays, space wind, etc.
        - Operating since 1997
    - Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
        - Discovered 3000 comets that disintegrate near the sun
        - Pulled in my gravity and destroyed
        - 95% of the discovered comets were by "citizen astronomers" - Enthusiast website watchers that report their findings
    - Voyager 2
        - First man made craft to ever flyby Neptune
        - Triton "was found to be the coldest known planetary body in the solar system" ([NASA | Voyager 2 Mission - Neptune Accomplishments][1])
        - Another moon with ice "volcano" or "cryovolcanism"



# Portfolio questions
- Why does mars have massive lithosphere?
	- And no volcanic activity
	- And *no* earthquakes?
- Is the astroid field to the sun as the saturn rings are to saturn?
- No plate tectonics on Venus
- If ice can squish and stretch more than rock with less force - do we have tectonics because the mass of the moon, and the distance of the sun, were just enough to break the crust up? Seen with Enceladus, the ice crust gets fractured and split.

# Include pictures of milky way taken in Aussie
# Include pictures taken of Northern lights
